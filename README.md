# Duolingo Notes

Duolingo Notes is a Google Chrome Extension can help the duolingo users save notes during learning.

This Extension is free on [Google Web Store | Duolingo Notes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duolingo-notes/fdhafjdcofficgjebiflfamofkoedieh). 

User Guide is availabe on [Duolingo | Duolingo Notes App - Help you learn Duolingo faster and better](https://www.duolingo.com/comment/2976444).

### Design Considerations
* I use chrome.storage (chrome.storage.sync) instead of IndexedDB because I want to sync the notes across different Google Chrome browsers easily.

### License
The app is under MIT License. The owl logo is owned by Duolingo. And the third party libraries are owned by original vendors.
